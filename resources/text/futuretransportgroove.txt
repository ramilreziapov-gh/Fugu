Future Transport Groove

Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Moving fast now
Innovation on the go, go, go now
Auto-auto-mated
Zero emissions
We'll transport it real efficient
On and on, let's get it

[Chorus]
High tech, moving low
Solving problems on the go, go, go
Tunnels, median flow
We cut the carbon, let the new system grow

[Verse 2]
Underground tracks
Conveyor belts with max facts
Small cargo, maximum impact
Shipping with ease
Making logistics a breeze
Japan's on the rise, you see

[Chorus]
High tech, moving low
Solving problems on the go, go, go
Tunnels, median flow
We cut the carbon, let the new system grow

[Bridge]
Transport, automated and clean
In Japan, it's all a dream
Environmental green
Efficiency like you've never seen

[Chorus]
High tech, moving low
Solving problems on the go, go, go
Tunnels, median flow
We cut the carbon, let the new system grow
