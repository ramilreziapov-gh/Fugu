Galactic Glide

Lyrics
[Verse 1]
A faint red star (yeah)
Moves through the galaxy far
G-g-galactic sky
In the Milky Way
Floating, we drift away
So far from here (oh)

[Chorus]
You light the dark, you spark the skies
You make make me go, go, go, lost in your eyes
I feel the pull, I feel the sway
As you glide, glide, through the Milky Way

[Verse 2]
Leaving trails of light
Through the cosmos, out of sight
F-f-fading glow
Center of the night
In your orbit, feeling right
Out the galaxy (oh)

[Chorus]
You light the dark, you spark the skies
You make make me go, go, go, lost in your eyes
I feel the pull, I feel the sway
As you glide, glide, through the Milky Way

[Bridge]
Red star on the move
Leaving our space groove
Finding the unknown
In your glow, I'm not alone (oh)

[Chorus]
You light the dark, you spark the skies
You make make me go, go, go, lost in your eyes
I feel the pull, I feel the sway
As you glide, glide, through the Milky Way
