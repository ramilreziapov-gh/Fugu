Patterns of Devotion

Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Pufferfish in the ocean, spinning 'round and 'round
Creating with devotion, patterns on the ground
Sculpting in the sand, a masterpiece so fine 
Impressing with his dance, in hopes she'll be mine
Days and nights I'm working, fins in constant flow
Art in every circle, see the love I'll show

[Chorus]
Pufferfish love
In the sand we groove
Pufferfish love
For you, I move

[Verse 2]
Every grain is special, precision is the key
In the center lay your eggs, the safest they will be
My heart is in each swirl, each line I meticulously trace
Hoping you'll admire the beauty of this place
Never rest, just building, for love that's true and grand
Come and see my artwork, designed in the sand

[Chorus]
Pufferfish love
In the sand we groove
Pufferfish love
For you, I move

[Bridge]
Patterns in motion
Deep ocean devotion
I spin just for you
In waves of love, so true

[Chorus]
Pufferfish love
In the sand we groove
Pufferfish love
For you, I move
