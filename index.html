    <h3>Fugu - Designer.</h3>
      <p>
        Male Japanese pufferfish in the Torquigener genus when it's time for them to find a mate, to impress their love interest â€”  demonstrate their artistic side, <br>sculpting a complex design into the sandy seafloor.<br><br>
        A male pufferfish will spend days spinning its fins to create a successful pattern that is both intricate and precise enough to capture a female pufferfish's eye.<br>
        Female pufferfish use the intricate structure as a nest; they lay their eggs in the center, where the finest grains of sand are collected.

      <p>
        The male pufferfish has only one thing acting in his favor to be chosen by the female pufferfish: the intricacy and impressiveness of the sand structure that he builds.

    <h3>Japan's Project Of A New Logistic System.</h3>
      <p>
        Japan is considering a project to develop automated logistics links that transport goods on median strips or through underground tunnels along expressways.<br>
        Up to a ton of small-sized cargo would be transported on automated carts or conveyor belts.<br>

        The project should help solve the logistics crisis and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

    <h3>Runaway Star.</h3>
    <h5>( A Faint Red Star Might Leave The Milky Way.)</h5>
      <p>
        A faint red star was discovered, moving about 1.3 million miles per hour (600 kilometers per second).

This rare stellar speedster is the first "hypervelocity" very low mass star found, <br>located just 400 light-years from Earth, it is the nearest known hypervelocity star to us.<br><br>

This star may be on an unusual trajectory that could cause it to leave the Milky Way altogether.<br>

The orbit is certainly the most surprising aspect of this object; it is moving radially in and out of the center of the Milky Way and almost perfectly in the plane.
<br>
The star was named CWISE J124909+362116.0 (or "J1249+36" for short).<br>

      <p>
        What gave this star a kick?<br><br>
Researchers focused on two possible scenarios to explain J1249+36's unusual trajectory.<br><br>

In the first scenario, J1249+36 was originally the low-mass companion of a white dwarf. In one of the types of white dwarfs, if the white dwarf collects too much mass, it can collapse and explode as a supernova.<br>

In this kind of supernova, the white dwarf is completely destroyed, so its companion is released and flies off at whatever orbital speed it was originally moving, plus a little bit of a kick from the supernova explosion as well.<br><br>

In the second scenario, J1249+36 was originally a member of a globular cluster, a tightly bound cluster of stars, immediately recognizable by its distinct spherical shape.<br> The centers of these clusters are predicted to contain black holes of a wide range of masses.<br> These black holes can also form binaries, and such systems turn out to be great catapults for any stars that happen to wander too close to them.
